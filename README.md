dotfiles
========

Central repository for all my dotfiles.

* bin: some simple and useful scripts (I include them in my path, personally place under ~/.local/bin)
* zshconfig: zsh configuration files that work with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/prezto-git)).
* vim: Vim customization (heavily inspired by [config-vim](https://github.com/mattjj/config-vim)).
I currently use with packages [vim-ctrlp](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/vim-ctrlp), [vim-surround](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/vim-surround), [vim-syntastic](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/vim-syntastic), [vim-latexsuite](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/vim-latexsuite), [julia-vim-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/julia-vim-git), [vim-rust-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vim-rust-git), [vim-commentary](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vim-commentary), [vim-unimpaired-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vim-unimpaired-git), [vim-pathogen](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vim-pathogen), and [vim-colors-zenburn](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vim-colors-zenburn).
At one point, I was using [vim-youcompleteme-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vim-youcompleteme-git) as well. Note that this plugin is significantly heavier than the others, but provides fantastic autocompletion capabilities.
* awesome: Awesome tiling WM customization (trimmed and modified from powerarrow-darker theme of [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats)).
This is meant to be used with the [lain-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lain-git) package for various widgets.
* alias: custom aliases, most from [aliases](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a9055e30f97bd19645c2).
* gitconfig: global git configuration
* tlp: a very useful (especially for laptops) advanced power management utility. See the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP), and the [project page](http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/tlp.html) for more information.
* tmux.conf: a simple tmux configuration obtained from various sources. Have not got around to using it much yet.
* xinitrc: nothing special here, except the standard caps lock/control key mapping especially useful for Vim.
